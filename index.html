      <li>
        <strong>2011–2014: <em>21</em>, worldwide recognition and hiatus</strong>
        <br> Adele released her second studio album, <em>21</em>, on 24 January 2011 in the UK and 22 February in the US. Adele told <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(magazine)">Spin Magazine:</a> "It was really exciting for me because I never grew up around that kind of music."

      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>2015–2017: <em>25</em> and <em>Adele Live 2016</em> </strong>
        <br> On the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a cryptic message via her Twitter account which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, "Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year," was interpreted by some in the media, including Capital FM, as meaning that her next album would be titled <em>25</em> and released later in the year.

      <li> <strong>2018–present: <em>30</em> </strong>
